1. compare levelling and vd and show that vd is super noisy using cogsci paper
2. demonstrate effectiveness of NB trained on nsyl and ending on levelling compared to cogsci paper. train NB using learning rate parameter space
3. do NB on test + posttest, levelling only. do baseline + test-based: computer, player, player correct, reverse player incorrect
4. profit?
